<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>First make sure the is a SQL table named ex4 running on a separate server.<br>
    Then run from IntelliJ this 'Ex4Application, and go to localhost:8080
</p>
<br>
<h2>Undefined Characteristics:</h2> <p>
    The Messages are held in SQL database. Access to them is by using beans (singleton),
in the appropriate places.<br>
    <br>
The list of active users is held in the Application Scope also by using a singleton bean.
<br>
Active users are maintained by "timestamping" this data structure everytime a user communicates
with the server, and every 9 seconds this data structure removes users who didn't communicate with the server
for over 10 seconds.

</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>A user cannot sign in with a name thats already taken.
</p>


<h2>Asynchronous Behavior</h2>
<p>Active Users singleton's access methods are synchronized due to concurrent use by potential users.
